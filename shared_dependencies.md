5. Message Names: The `app/routes.py` file will handle the following message names: `send_message`, `receive_message`, `login`, `register`, `view_profile`.

6. Function Names: The `app/main.py` file will contain the main function to run the app. The `app/routes.py` file will contain functions to handle each route such as `login()`, `register()`, `chatroom()`, `user_profile()`. The `app/models.py` file will contain functions to handle database operations such as `add_user()`, `get_user()`, `add_message()`, `get_messages()`.
